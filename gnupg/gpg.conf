# Keyserver
# --------
#
# While this is useful, always remember to try downloading keys locally and
# verifying them manually (e.g. physical Web of Trust). Also pools (e.g. sks)
# are now down...

# This is the server that --recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will
# communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on
keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org/

# Set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP keyservers - default to the standard
# local Tor socks proxy
# It is encouraged to use Tor for improved anonymity. Preferrably use either a
# dedicated SOCKSPort for GnuPG and/or enable IsolateDestPort and
# IsolateDestAddr
#keyserver-options http-proxy=socks5-hostname://127.0.0.1:9050

# Don't leak DNS, see https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2846
#keyserver-options no-try-dns-srv

# When using --refresh-keys, if the key in question has a preferred keyserver
# URL, then disable use of that preferred keyserver to refresh the key from
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url

# When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are marked on
# the keyserver as revoked
