Nicolas Paul's Neovim configuration and utils
=============================================

This project contains a powerful and custom-tailored Neovim configuration
to provide a great user experience editing both toy and complex codebases,
as well as writing efficiently (even if VIM is strongly encouraged for this
use case).

Additionally, some private plugins and utilities co-exist here.
